Disney Plus
The copy of the Disney Plus web application

In the project I used such tools as Webpack, Typescript, React, Redux, Firebase, Styled components, scss. To keep my code clean I used MVC architecture pattern, webpack aliases, asset url constants, mapped components, etc

I'll leave additional comments as the project progresses :)
